This code is the most refined prototype I have managed to create for a calculator in C#, trying to follow good programming practices and making it as readable and understandable as possible for anyone. I used several concepts I learned up to the point of its creation (methods, operations, switches, if-else statements, etc.).  
These are my first steps in this language, so any corrections are welcome.  
I hope that for someone new to programming (just like me), this code will be useful and help them learn something.
